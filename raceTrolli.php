Resource: Fury <!--schimba-->

The rage that fills true barbarians cannot be extinguished so long as they live. Fury, a resource that represents pure anger and battle-lust, powers their every terrifying strike.

Fury rises in barbarians as they are damaged, and when they draw their enemies’ blood. As barbarians suffer increasing damage from their enemies (and quickly cut them down in response) their Fury builds to a peak.

Excess Fury can be put to explosive use – barbarians can smash and destroy the battlefield, hurl themselves through the air, and split their opponents in two.

Outside of combat, Fury wanes quickly, so adept Barbarians charge from battle to battle to ensure that they can continually deliver devastating attacks.

    Melee Mastery//Ranged Fury(special)
    Barbarians casually swing weapons that ordinary warriors can barely lift. They’re able to fight with a full-sized blade, hammer, or axe gripped in each fist, or with enormous (but ponderous) great weapons that crush their enemies into paste.
    Brutal Attacks
    Strength and anger go well together. When they lend plenty of Fury to their strikes, barbarians can send their foes flying, shear their limbs off, or knock their bones free of their flesh.
    Shouts
    Barbarians are mighty presences on the battlefield, and their ferocious war cries can bring out battle frenzy in their allies or send their tiny foes fleeing in terror. Even mighty foes who hear a barbarian’s shout can become too shaken to land their most deadly blows.
    Taking Hits
    No other heroes can shrug off enemy attacks the way that barbarians do. Their massive strength allows them to equip heavy shields, and their flesh deflects oncoming blades and teeth like metal armor.
    
    
Resource: Essence

To overwhelm those who attempt to disrupt the Balance, necromancers rely on Essence. They use it to animate the dead, curse enemies, and command minions.

As a static resource, necromancers only have as much Essence as they harvest from their enemies. It does not fill up slowly over time, nor does it decay. Due to this peculiarity, necromancers who are careless may find themselves out of Essence when they need it most.

Necromancers who make the most of their power embrace the balance between exhausting Essence reserves and obtaining more from enemies, forever looking to the next battle. A necromancer with a full Essence pool is a terrifying adversary indeed—but they must carefully use their spells to keep enemies at bay.
Key Features

    Pets
    Witch doctors are surrounded by hordes of things - mongrels, zombies, bats, fetishes, spiders and more. Many of these creatures stand beside their masters and fight until they are slain, serving as convenient targets in the meantime.
    Destructive Magic
    Witch doctors command frightful magics that damage groups of enemies with clouds of acid, gouts of flame and swarms of locusts. They can even sacrifice the bodies of their pets to ravage their foes in a wave of bony shrapnel.
    Curses and Hexes
    Weakening and slow-killing hexes can help soften and invalidate even the most terrible of the Burning Hells's minions. Witch doctors employ a number of these curses, including debilitating poisons and bolts of spirit energy that steal life and vitality.
    Battlefield Control
    Those who battle witch doctors find their bodies and minds twisted, limiting their effectiveness in combat. The enemies of the Unformed Land are held in place by ghastly undead hands, transformed into chickens, and sent fleeing in fear or striking at their fellows in utter bewilderment.
