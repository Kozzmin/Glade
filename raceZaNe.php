Gift of the Naaru <!--schimba-->

Cultivation

Arcane Acuity
Blood elves possess a preternatural talent for precision and gain a bonus to their critical strike chance.

Blood elves can disrupt magic, removing one beneficial effect from enemies around them and restoring some of their own resources.
Arcane Affinity
Blood elves are skilled in the mystical arts and receive a skill bonus to enchanting.
Magic Resistance
Blood elves have a natural resistance to arcane magic spells.
Elemental Mastery
Wizards claim dominion over the natural elements of Sanctuary. Crackling flames, bolts of lightning, blasts of ice and whirlwinds are at their command, and this versatility enables them to target foes’ weaknesses and bypass their defenses.
Area Attacks
The battlefield is covered in the forces summoned by a powerful wizard – cones and blasts that hit large groups of creatures at once, rays that punish them for standing close together, and falling rocks that crush those who idle.
Protective Spells
Though not as physically agile or strong as some other heroes, wizards cloak themselves in defensive magics. They can encase their skin in diamonds, create mirror images to befuddle their enemies, and harm or slow those foolish enough to strike at them directly.
Endless Energy
Wizards rarely find themselves without the power of magic. They can nearly always afford to cast their weaker spells thanks to their swiftly-regenerating Arcane Power, and they invoke certain powers more easily as their experience grows. 
Unlike more deliberate and cautious magic-users, wizards are lightning rods for Arcane Power. An intense energy courses through them, and they direct it as though it were an extension of their own bodies.

Wizards continually crackle with Arcane Power – it regenerates itself quickly, and so they can call upon their lesser abilities seemingly without end. They are only in danger of depleting their stores of energy when attempting a number of invocations at once.

However, Arcane Power can ravage wizards’ bodies if its use is not carefully paced, so Wizards must endure a cooldown period before repeatedly casting certain potent spells. These spells – conjured meteors falling from the sky, torrents of force that shove multiple foes off their feet, or energy bubbles that halt the flow of time itself – are so powerful that they are worth the wait.
Key Features

    Born Defender
    More than any other hero on Sanctuary, a crusader is built to stand statuesque against endless attacks. Crusaders protect allies (and stoke their own Wrath) by forcing enemies to face them in combat. When surrounded, they grow even more difficult to kill; healing wounds, blocking attacks and reflecting damage back to the foes that break against their iron defenses.
    Fury of the Heavens
    The heavens themselves punish the enemies of a crusader. A crusader’s Wrath obliterates the minions of the Burning Hells from afar, striking them with lightning, engulfing them in cleansing flames, or executing them with summoned celestial weapons.
    Laws
    Valor and dedication radiate from crusaders, reaffirming the very reality that they defend. When crusaders proclaim a law, they’re empowered with short bursts of energy, as well as long-term boons – like swift strikes, resistance to the elements or faster healing – that endure as long as the crusade does.
    Inescapable
    It’s natural for evil to flee the might of the crusader – but futile. With summoned steeds, leaping assaults and practiced charges into combat, crusaders are relentless in pursuit of their enemies. They can easily blind or immobilize their adversaries, ensuring that a flight from justice remains impossible
    
Resource: Wrath

Crusaders dominate battlefields through sheer purpose. The support of the heavenly Light and the sanctity of their quest lend Wrath to a crusader’s punishing attacks.

As crusaders prepare for combat, their Wrath simmers, increasing slowly but steadily. When they cut down their foes, it boils over. A crusader overfull with Wrath is a dangerous adversary indeed: blessed with iron skin; swathed in scourging flames; blasting foes apart with bolts of radiant light, and springing back to life after defeat.

Resourceful crusaders find means beyond dispatching enemies to fuel their Wrath. Their many skills allow them to recover spent resources through blocking attacks, suffering serious injuries, or when they’re encircled by snarling demons.


Resource: Mana

Witch doctors’ inborn connection to the Unformed Land allows them to tap into a deep well of spiritual energy, called Mana.

Mana is a vast but slowly-regenerating resource; witch doctors must be choosy with their attack spells and hexes to ensure that they don’t leave themselves depleted of power and exposed to enemy attacks.

Since Mana returns ponderously, witch doctors conserve it by relying on semi-permanent additions to their arsenal, such as their summoned mongrels and the horrific gargantuan, which can offer protection and chew through enemies without any further mana cost.

Witch doctors have a sizeable reservoir of energy to call upon at once, and, when they need to, they can deploy immense blasts of destructive force and cut a swath across nearly any battleground in a short period of time.

Elves were born of water, making them fluid, agile, and infused with good magic. Deeply in tune with the forces of nature, they worship Eva, the second Goddess of Water. Elves excel at beneficial magic, archery, and singing above all.
