<h1 class="welcomeMain">RASA ELF</h1>

<p class="welcomeMain">Shadowmeld<!--Schimba-->
Night Elves can slip into the shadows, awaiting for the right moment to strike.
Engineering Specialization
Their expertise with gizmos, gadgets, and gimmicks provides gnomes with a skill bonus to engineering.
Running Wild
Drop to all fours to run as fast as a wild animal. Who needs a mount when you can run?
Escape Artist
Gnomes are small and nimble, which allows them to extricate themselves from even the most cunning traps.
Expansive Mind
Curious, creative, and brilliant, gnomes receive a small bonus to their resource pool.
Rocket Jump
Goblins can use their (relatively) trusty rocket belts to launch themselves over short distances.
Rocket Barrage
The rocket belt can also launch rockets at an enemy, causing fire damage to the target.

Traps
When hunting packs of demons or giant horrors much stronger than themselves, canny hunters come prepared. Luring enemies into mines, caltrops, or steel-jawed traps can soften them up, ensuring an easy – and guaranteed – kill.
Shadow Magic
In order to better their chances against the forces of the Burning Hells, demon hunters embrace apocryphal magics. They can cloak themselves in darkness, confound others’ attacks, and slip between shadows to sneak up on their prey.
Battle Tactics
Demon hunters carry the scars and burns of their pasts, and, despite the path they’ve chosen, they have no desire to suffer again. Hunters hold their enemies at range with hamstringing arrows, or slow them with entangling bolas, and they drop smoke bombs to escape when foes draw dangerously close. 

Resource: Hatred / Discipline

Demon hunters are perpetually at war with themselves. They hold no hope for a return to their former lives, but they fight and stalk demons with a passion. Those hunters who live to train others become deliberate and cautious and, yet, their impulses scream to meet demonic violence with more violence.

Every arrow that demon hunters launch is dipped in spite; nearly all of their attacks are delivered with Hatred, a cold, righteous anger that renders them utterly merciless to their enemies. Their Hatred is nearly endless; it recovers quickly, as, even at rest, demon hunters are filled with the desire for vengeance.

Those hunters who would hope to make any sort of true impact must temper their Hatred with a second resource: Discipline, the caution and care that ensures they live to kill another day.

Discipline is precious to demon hunters. Not only does it return slowly, requiring more reflection and patience than their Hatred-based attacks, but they must rely on it for every defensive maneuver – trapping enemies in place, vaulting out of the way of teeth and claws, and dodging hails of spines and arrows.

It is a simple matter for demon hunters to stand in place, icy with Hatred, and send a volley of projectiles at the hordes of their enemies. But, when they fail to defend themselves with Discipline, hunters leave themselves able to be slaughtered. A careful balance of Discipline and Hatred is the most likely way hunters ensure their survival.
Key Features

    Spiritual Power
    As monks land subsequent attacks, they build up a reserve of Spirit that they can expend in amazing maneuvers – disorienting multiple foes, knocking groups back, or dashing in and out of melee.
    Combos
    Monks’ melee attacks are more potent when they’re used in careful succession; they generate additional spiritual energy, deal increased damage and produce unique effects that can enable a monk to defeat nearly any enemy.
    Mantras
    Disciplined monks can make the force of their spirit manifest, projecting it outward with a mantra, a long-lasting mantle of power which can heal or strengthen the projecting monk or any nearby allies.
    Mobility and Speed
    Monks possess peerless tactical mobility on the battlefield. Any monk is able to quickly move between or around enemies, flanking them or striking at their vitals as the situation demands, and defense-focused monks are more adept at dodging enemy attacks than any other class.

Resource: Spirit

To defeat the inhuman evils they pit themselves against, monks draw upon inner reserves of Spirit, a resource that reflects their personal mastery and training.

Spirit replenishes slowly. It is generated in two ways – by specific skills and attacks, and by the completion of combos. Monks who chain their attacks carefully can continue a near-endless barrage of Spirit-fueled strikes.

Spirit is a valuable resource, but massive expenditures of this force allow a monk to call upon potent dodges and defensive moves, as well as monster-slaying finishing strikes.

Thanks to monks’ physical perfection and martial talent, they are free to deliver as many empowered strikes as their Spirit pools will allow – without waiting for ability ‘cooldowns.’
